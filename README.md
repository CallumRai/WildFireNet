# Description
## The Problem
Between 1972 and 2018 California has seen a 5-fold increase in itâ€™s annual burned area. As the climate crisis deepens, wildfires are expected increase further and with it must come preventative action. Wildfires are notoriously hard to predict with a vast array of differing indicators from wind speed to soil moisture. 

## Our Solution
WildFireNet is a deep artificial neural network which uses weather and satelitte data to foresee the likelihood of a wildfire starting, and remaining active, 7 days after the given date at which the climate evaluation is made, or 30 days after the date at which the climate evaluation is made.

# Structure
- `data`: Contains datasets used for training and predicting

- `preprocess`: `clean.py` combines and cleans datasets, `predict.py` creates dataset to prediction features, and `transform.py` turns clean dataset into features

- `results`: Contains notebook showing predictions resulting from the preliminary model.

- `train`: Contains the notebook in which the preliminary model was trained (Note: The model was trained using smaller versions of the datasets which can found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1G8R_xnjWk9WEXvx_hwYQT3rgDVywe1lW?usp=sharing)

# Results
Results can be viewed by consulting the files found in `results`. Here you can enter a location in the USA, in addition to other relevant data attributes (said attributes may be found in the training notebook) and the model's prediction will be returned.

# Future
Future iterations of this will include:
- Lower radiuses of space considered to make more precise predictions.
- Geo-spatial data considered with convolutional neural networks.
- Consideration of wildfire vs other fires (e.g. house fires)
- Real time weather data.
- Global scaling
 
 # Use cases
 WildFireNet has a cast array of use cases, from apps utilising a Watson chat bot and Here location services to notify residents of fire-risk, to dashboards to help firefighters identify high-risk areas and take preventative action.
